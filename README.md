MD5 hashes for all No-Intro NES ROM dumps.

### List of MD5 sums:

### What is No-Intro?

What "No-Intro" does is fill some `.dat` files, to be used with ROM-Managers, with information about the known ROMS released. Often there are more versions of the same ROM dump, but most of them are garbage, some examples may include: bad dumps, hacks, fakes, overdumps, underdumps, and so on. "No-Intro" lists only the best available ROM; it must be a full dump with no faults and no changes to the file, basically just the ROMS that are the closest as possible to the original licensed cartridges.

**Note 1**: Certain system's (Atari - 7800, Atari - Lynx, Nintendo - Famicom Disk System, and Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System) roms include what are called headers to tell the emulator how to load and run the rom's binary information. Because headers are not part of the physical ROM's information, a method is required to strip them out when running clrmamepro to verify the true dumped information for that ROM. No-Intro ROM header skipper plugins for clrmamepro can be downloaded from the DAT-o-MATIC as well.

### What is this specific list?

This is a list of the md5 hashes for both the `.nes` ROM files, as well as the `.zip` archive file. The md5sums for the `.zip` is less important than the `.nes` md5sums, but I included all of them posterity. Nothing is missing from this set. There are 3060 of 3060 known NES ROMs (Headered) as of July 31 2020.
